# Kpop-back-end
We have created a Kpop trivia and blog site. This site is for fans of Kpop! If you love this music genre like we do, then you will get a kick out of this site. (This is the back end side. At the bottom of this readme in the Mock up section is the link for acquiring the front end side.)
