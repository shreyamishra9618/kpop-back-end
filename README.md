Fandom life made easier and more dynamic. Stay connected with your artists on K-pop Trivia Fever! Here you can play quizes, read blogs and create quizes or blog related to your favorite K-pop group or idol.

This is the backend part consisting of sql data base for the k-pop react based web application.




## Use




## Mock up


## Collaboration
Mo Risk- She was responsible for most of the CSS, and getting the quiz and blog pages up and ruinning. She made sure that users can get their questions and answers entered and saved for others to have fun. Mo made sure that users were able to connect a picture to their quiz and or blog.

Michelle Beaudoin- She was responsible for the wiki page, she made sure each card had a photo, and when clicked there was wiki information on each person or group that was on the specific card. She filled the data file with all of the info used. She also created our README so others may use this project.

##
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
